# Slithering Challenge

The "Slithering Challenge" is a multi-level snake game built using the Python programming language and the curses library for terminal-based graphics. The game provides an engaging and challenging experience for players as they control a snake to collect food, avoid obstacles, and compete for high scores.


## How to Play

Welcome to the Slithering Challenge! This multi-level snake game offers an engaging and competitive experience as you navigate your snake through various levels of difficulty. Collect food, avoid obstacles, and aim for high scores to prove your skills.

+ Objective:
Navigate your snake through the playing field, collect food to grow, and avoid obstacles and collisions. Complete each level's objectives within the time limit to progress to the next level.

+ Controls:

    Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of your snake's movement.
    Press the "Enter" key to confirm your name when saving your score.
+ Gameplay:

1. Snake Movement: Control the snake's movement to collect food and grow longer. Avoid hitting walls, the snake's own body, and obstacles.
1. Food: Collect food items represented by "*". Each food item collected increases your score and snake length.
1. Obstacles: Obstacles are represented by "X" and are placed strategically throughout the field. Avoid colliding with obstacles to stay alive.
1. Timer: Each level has a time limit. Complete the level's objectives before the timer runs out to avoid losing a life.
1. Lives: You start with a set number of lives. Colliding with obstacles or running out of time reduces your lives. If lives reach zero, the game ends.
1. Scoring: Earn points by collecting food items. Your score increases with each food item collected.
1. Level Progression: Complete objectives to advance to the next level. Each level introduces new challenges, such as faster snake speeds and additional obstacles.
+ Saving Your Score:

    After completing a level or when prompted, decide whether to save your score.
    If you choose to save your score, enter your name using ASCII characters.
    Your score will be saved to the game's leaderboard, where you can compete against other players.
